ClearSkies VFR is a Microsoft-stack C# application that helps pilots quickly determine if current and forecasted conditions support safe Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flying. The app retrieves real-time aviation weather (METAR/TAF), classifies flight category (VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR), calculates density altitude, and performs crosswind/headwind checks for selected runways. Built with .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, .NET MAUI, Entity Framework Core, and Azure, its purpose is to provide a quick, accurate, and user-friendly tool for pilots to assess weather conditions at a glance. Pilots often need to check multiple sources for METAR, TAF, crosswind, and density altitude data; ClearSkies consolidates these into a single instant report. Primary users include general aviation pilots, student pilots, flight instructors, and aviation enthusiasts. Core features include live METAR/TAF retrieval from NOAA and AVWX REST API with global ICAO support, automatic flight category classification based on FAA thresholds, density altitude calculation using airport-specific field elevation, crosswind and headwind component calculation from runway headings, a runway catalog preloaded with major airports, and planned weather alerts and multi-platform UI. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns: ClearSkies.Domain holds business logic, models, and calculations; ClearSkies.Infrastructure handles data retrieval and the airport catalog; ClearSkies.Api serves endpoints like /airports/{icao}/conditions in JSON; ClearSkies.App (planned) will provide a MAUI cross-platform front-end; Azure integration (planned) will host the API, store data in Azure SQL, and send alerts via Functions. Locally, you can build with .NET 8, run the API, and access Swagger UI or test with curl. Example output includes ICAO, category, observed time, wind details, visibility, ceiling, temperature, altimeter, headwind, crosswind, and density altitude. The roadmap includes completing the MAUI UI, adding route planning, METAR history, and deploying to Azure
